# SpdRdr

SpdRdr is an application used to increase the rate at which you read text on your device of choice: iOS, Android, and web! Simply paste text into the input or select a text file on your device to start speed reading. Use the handy slider to set the speed at which the app displays a single word of text on the screen. You can range anywhere from 100 to 3000 words per minute!

This is primarily built for mobile devices but there is a web app build available at http://spdrdr.surge.sh. Try it out!

App is awaiting approval to be available on the Google Play Store. Stay tuned!
